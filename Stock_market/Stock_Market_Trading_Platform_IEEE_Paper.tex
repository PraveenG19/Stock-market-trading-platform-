\section{Introduction}
The stock market plays a pivotal role in the global economy, serving as a platform for companies to raise capital and investors to trade securities. With the advancement of technology, digital platforms have become essential for accessing real-time stock market information. Traditional trading methods have evolved to incorporate sophisticated data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance decision-making processes.

This research presents a web-based stock market trading platform that combines real-time data processing with AI-powered analytics to provide traders with comprehensive tools for informed decision-making. The system offers features such as real-time stock price tracking, technical analysis indicators, portfolio management, and predictive analytics based on machine learning models.

The contributions of this paper are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design and implementation of a comprehensive stock trading platform
    \item Integration of real-time market data with AI-powered analytics
    \item Development of predictive models for stock price forecasting
    \item Implementation of a user-friendly interface for trading activities
    \item Performance evaluation of the system's real-time capabilities
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}
Several researchers have explored the application of artificial intelligence in stock market prediction. Mittal et al. \cite{mittal2019stock} proposed a stock market prediction model using machine learning techniques. Patel et al. \cite{patel2015predicting} compared various machine learning models for stock market prediction. Enke and Thao \cite{enke2013forecasting} developed a hybrid approach for forecasting stock markets using technical indicators and neural networks.

Web-based trading platforms have also been extensively studied. Chen et al. \cite{chen2018design} designed a web-based stock trading system with real-time data visualization. Kumar et al. \cite{kumar2020intelligent} proposed an intelligent stock trading system using sentiment analysis.

However, existing solutions often lack integration of multiple analytical tools in a single platform or do not provide real-time AI-powered trading signals. This research addresses these limitations by developing a comprehensive platform that combines real-time data processing with advanced analytics.

\section{System Architecture}
The Stock Market Trading Platform follows a client-server architecture with multiple interconnected components. The system architecture is designed to handle real-time data processing, user interactions, and AI-powered analytics.

\subsection{Overall Architecture}
The system consists of three main layers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Presentation Layer:} Provides the user interface through web browsers
    \item \textbf{Business Logic Layer:} Implements core functionalities including data processing, analytics, and trading operations
    \item \textbf{Data Layer:} Manages data storage and external API integrations
\end{enumerate}

\caption{Data Flow Diagram Showing Information Movement Through the System}
\label{fig:dataflow}
\end{figure}

This diagram illustrates the complex data flows within the system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item External data sources (Yahoo Finance, News APIs) feed into the system
    \item User interactions drive authentication and trading processes
    \item Data is processed through multiple engines (Market Data, Technical Analysis, AI/ML)
    \item Results are stored in databases and caches for efficient retrieval
    \item Processed information is presented to users through the interface
\end{itemize}

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{AI/ML Model Architecture Diagram}
\label{fig:ai_ml_architecture}
\end{figure}

The AI/ML architecture consists of multiple components working in parallel:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Sources:} Both historical and real-time market data are used as inputs
    \item \textbf{Preprocessing:} Data is cleaned, normalized, and transformed into features suitable for machine learning
    \item \textbf{Multiple Models:} Three different algorithms are employed to capture various aspects of market behavior:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item LSTM Neural Networks for sequential pattern recognition
            \item Support Vector Machines for classification tasks
            \item Random Forest for ensemble-based predictions
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ensemble Method:} Combines predictions from all models for improved accuracy
    \item \textbf{Outputs:} Generates both price forecasts and trading signals with confidence metrics
\end{itemize}

\section{AI-Powered Trading Signals}
The platform incorporates machine learning algorithms to generate trading signals based on market data analysis. The AI system evaluates multiple factors including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages)
    \item Price momentum and volatility
    \item Market sentiment analysis
    \item Historical price patterns
\end{itemize}

The system generates three types of signals:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{BUY Signal:} Indicates favorable conditions for purchasing a stock
    \item \textbf{SELL Signal:} Indicates favorable conditions for selling a stock
    \item \textbf{HOLD Signal:} Indicates neutral market conditions
\end{enumerate}

Each signal is accompanied by a confidence percentage (70-99\%) and market outlook information.

\section{User Interface and Experience}
