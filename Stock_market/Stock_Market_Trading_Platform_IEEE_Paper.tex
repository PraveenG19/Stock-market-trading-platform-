\section{Introduction}
The stock market plays a pivotal role in the global economy, serving as a platform for companies to raise capital and investors to trade securities. With the advancement of technology, digital platforms have become essential for accessing real-time stock market information. Traditional trading methods have evolved to incorporate sophisticated data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance decision-making processes.

This research presents a web-based stock market trading platform that combines real-time data processing with AI-powered analytics to provide traders with comprehensive tools for informed decision-making. The system offers features such as real-time stock price tracking, technical analysis indicators, portfolio management, and predictive analytics based on machine learning models.

The contributions of this paper are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design and implementation of a comprehensive stock trading platform
    \item Integration of real-time market data with AI-powered analytics
    \item Development of predictive models for stock price forecasting
    \item Implementation of a user-friendly interface for trading activities
    \item Performance evaluation of the system's real-time capabilities
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}
Several researchers have explored the application of artificial intelligence in stock market prediction. Mittal et al. \cite{mittal2019stock} proposed a stock market prediction model using machine learning techniques. Patel et al. \cite{patel2015predicting} compared various machine learning models for stock market prediction. Enke and Thao \cite{enke2013forecasting} developed a hybrid approach for forecasting stock markets using technical indicators and neural networks.

Web-based trading platforms have also been extensively studied. Chen et al. \cite{chen2018design} designed a web-based stock trading system with real-time data visualization. Kumar et al. \cite{kumar2020intelligent} proposed an intelligent stock trading system using sentiment analysis.

However, existing solutions often lack integration of multiple analytical tools in a single platform or do not provide real-time AI-powered trading signals. This research addresses these limitations by developing a comprehensive platform that combines real-time data processing with advanced analytics.

\section{System Architecture}
The Stock Market Trading Platform follows a client-server architecture with multiple interconnected components. The system architecture is designed to handle real-time data processing, user interactions, and AI-powered analytics.

\subsection{Overall Architecture}
The system consists of three main layers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Presentation Layer:} Provides the user interface through web browsers
    \item \textbf{Business Logic Layer:} Implements core functionalities including data processing, analytics, and trading operations
    \item \textbf{Data Layer:} Manages data storage and external API integrations
\end{enumerate}
